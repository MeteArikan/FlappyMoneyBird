# Flappy Money Bird


The classic Flappy Bird loop with two new ways to play:

Yellow Bird - The classic game you love (or love to hate)

Red Bird - Collect the coins in a row to build combo streaks and get bonus points! Precision now pays big.

Blue Bird - Pipes do not only move horizontally but also vertically now.

Controls:

Press space to start and fly,  use mouse to click the buttons

IMPORTANT NOTE: â€‹ Unfortunately, there is a resolution misconfiguration in mobile, therefore the other modes are not playable, but you can still play the classic mode.
